            <h2>Ancient Pioneers</h2>
            <p>The foundations of mathematics were laid by brilliant minds across different civilizations. From Pythagoras, whose theorem we still learn in schools, to Archimedes, who ran naked through the streets shouting "Eureka!" after making a mathematical discovery. The ancient Babylonians developed sophisticated mathematical systems for astronomy and architecture, while Indian mathematicians like Aryabhata made groundbreaking advances in trigonometry and place value notation.</p>

            <h2>Revolutionary Thinkers</h2>
            <p>The Renaissance and Enlightenment periods saw an explosion of mathematical innovation. Euler, often called the most prolific mathematician in history, developed crucial concepts in calculus, graph theory, and analysis. Gauss, the "Prince of Mathematics," made fundamental contributions to number theory, statistics, and non-Euclidean geometry. Ada Lovelace, often considered the first computer programmer, saw the potential for mathematics to go beyond mere calculation to algorithmic thinking.</p>

            <h2>Modern Innovators</h2>
            <p>The 20th century brought new challenges and solutions. Emmy Noether revolutionized abstract algebra and theoretical physics, despite facing discrimination as a woman in academia. Alan Turing's mathematical work laid the foundation for computer science and artificial intelligence. The recent solution to the Poincar√© Conjecture by Grigori Perelman shows that mathematics continues to evolve and surprise us.</p>
